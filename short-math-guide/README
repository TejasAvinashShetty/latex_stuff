========================================================================

The Short Math Guide is intended to be a concise introduction to the use
of the facilities provided by amsmath and various other LaTeX packages
for typesetting mathematical notation.

The collection consists of three files:
short-math-guide.tex, short-math-guide.pdf, and this README file.

Macros needed for formatting the LaTeX source are embedded in the tex
file using \filecontents and when the file is processed, an additional
file, mathdoc.sty, will be written out.
